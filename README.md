AVPASS
======

AVPASS is a tool for leaking the detection model of Android malware detection systems (i.e., antivirus software), and bypassing their detection logics by using the leaked information coupled with APK obfuscation techniques. AVPASS is not limited to detection features used by detection systems, and can also infer detection rules so that it can disguise any Android malware as a benign application by automatically transforming the APK binary. To prevent leakage of the application logic during transformation, AVPASS provides an Imitation Mode that allows malware developers to safely query curious detection features without sending the entire binary.

AVPASS offers several useful features to transform any Android malware so it can bypass anti-virus software. Below are the main features AVPASS offers:

- APK obfuscation with more than 10 modules
- Feature inference for the detection system by using individual obfuscation
- Rule inference of the detection system by using the 2k factorial experiment
- Targeted obfuscation to bypass a specific detection system
- Safe query support by using Imitation Mode

Installation

Download the repository from github

git clone https://github.com/sslab-gatech/avpass

Run the installer with the command

./install-dep.sh

Using

Next, we need a generated build of a virus for Android. This could be, for example, the RAT from AhMyth. For basic disguise, you just need to write
Also do not forget that credits goes to trojans telegram group

python gen_disguise.py -i <file name> individual

The generated apk file is not detected by most antiviruses (perhaps one), and its system requirements are hidden from the user during installation.
